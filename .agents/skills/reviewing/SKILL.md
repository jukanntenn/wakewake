# Reviewing a harness-deepseek-harness PR

**This skill is guidance, not a complete checklist.** Verify and fetch the PR's live base and exact head, then run `uv run hdsh scope --base <verified-base-ref> --head <verified-head-ref>` before reading the diff and enough surrounding code to understand the design. The report identifies paths and dirty layers but does not replace semantic review. Re-establish the base and rerun it after a retarget or merge. Prioritize correctness, lifecycle, security, and broken required behavior over style; a short review with one substantiated blocker is better than a list of nits.

## Sources of truth

- [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md): standing repository rules.
- [docs/AGENTS.md](../../../docs/AGENTS.md): documentation placement and prose discipline.
- [editing-prose](../editing-prose/SKILL.md): required coverage and editorial judgment for comments, docs, diagnostics, and CLI strings.
- [RFCs](../../rfcs/README.md) (`.agents/rfcs/`): design rationale and decisions. Treat disagreement with an RFC as a design discussion, not an automatic veto.
- For bilingual changes, read [translation-rules.md](../../../docs/i18n/translation-rules.md) and [terminology.md](../../../docs/i18n/terminology.md); the extended translation skill is outside automatic review and runs only on explicit user invocation.

## Blocking requirements

1. **New prose receives semantic review.** Use [editing-prose](../editing-prose/SKILL.md) to critically review every added or changed Markdown passage, docstring, comment, diagnostic, and visible string. Verify required coverage, accuracy, placement, and editorial quality against the owning code or behavior; automated checks do not establish those properties.
2. **Docs match the code.** Config, defaults, errors, CLI output, exit codes, and public behavior update the owning README and docstrings in the same diff. Comments state non-obvious contracts; flag implementation narration, test walkthroughs, review history, and duplicated rationale for deletion or a link to their one home.
3. **Required evidence exists.** Verify the author ran the [relevant local checks](../../../AGENTS.md#run-relevant-checks-locally) for the diff and that CI covers the exhaustive matrix; review the semantic gaps neither can detect.

## Manual checks

- **Intent and interface contracts:** trace both sides of every changed interface. Confirm the implementation matches the PR and any RFC, including errors, cancellation, ownership, and disposal.
- **Lifecycle and concurrency:** for async setup, subprocesses, locks, filesystem state, or teardown, check races before publication, cancellation during waits, independent error reporting, ownership before reentry, complete cleanup, and quiescent disposal.
- **Scope, ownership, and necessity:** map each abstraction, state machine, option, and defensive copy to its current contract and production consumer. Challenge unrelated features and speculative generality, then test the PR against [the root rules](../../../AGENTS.md#conventions).
- **Configuration and public choices:** ask what current-consumer evidence or prior art supports each default, public operation set, format, or imported external concept. Require an explicit choice or deferral when that evidence is absent.
- **Enforcement:** follow every denial path to the operation that executes it; exercise direct and alternate callers that can bypass argument parsing, validation, wrappers, or configuration.
- **Borrowed and derived state:** determine whether each retained value is borrowed or owned, then trace every cache or derived view to its authoritative source and documented refresh point.
- **Real entry path:** tests reach the real public surface rather than hand-imported helpers, so argument-parsing and exit-code regressions cannot hide.

Backend integration tests exercise the real axum routers against live PostgreSQL (the database and SSE Hub are never mocked), frontend unit tests run through the component tree in Vitest, and e2e tests drive the exported UI in Playwright chromium.

- **Test strength:** assertions fail on the intended regression and verify external state, logs, events, or disposal rather than restating the implementation or trusting an agent's report. Coverage is necessary but not evidence that the scenario is correct.
- **Negative controls:** verify that a deliberately invalid case fails through the real gate or runner for the intended rule.
- **Implemented RFCs match shipped reality:** when a PR implements a proposed RFC, move it to `implemented/` and rewrite it as present-tense shipped state in the same diff, then verify paths, names, and mechanisms against the implementation.
- **Bilingual changes:** compare meaning and terminology on both sides; a green pairing hash does not prove translation quality.

## Reporting findings

State the defect, location, impact, and evidence. Place a localized defect inline on the tightest relevant diff range; use a PR-level comment for cross-cutting architecture, scope, or review-wide synthesis. Separate blockers from suggestions and omit issues already enforced by a green gate. Use the existing GitHub review thread for replies. When receiving review, verify each claim and fix or rebut it on technical grounds without performative agreement.
